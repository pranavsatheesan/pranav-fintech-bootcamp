## Description

### P2P Lending -Lendingloop

What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?: 
Lending Loop (LL) is Canada's first fully regulated peer-to-peer lending platform focused on small businesses. Lending Loop introduces both retail and institutional capital to small businesses through unsecured business term loans. LL till recently did not have any competition in Canada within the P2P lending segment. It has enjoyed a first mover advantage and impact of competition in the sector is yet to materialize. The key competitor is GoPeer.

How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?
LL does not use any new sophisticated technology. Lending is facilitated through online website which has a database of loan requests and investors for the loans. Credit Risk rating for loan requests is performed using in house algorithms. Investors will purchase securities in the form of notes which correspond to their funding for the loan.

Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
Peer to peer lending took off in many jurisdictions in the early 2010s. Canada did not have a player in this space till 2016 when LL arrived. Currently there is only one other
competitor in the country (GoPeer). LL borrowers in general cannot access traditional means of loan finance due to inherent credit risk in the business. These borrowers are therefore
charged a higher rate on the LL loans. As worldwide, loose monetary policy has led to lower interest rates which results in investors who are hungry for higher yields. Therefore retail and institutional investors are available to invest in such higher risk private loans. LL provides a platform where such lenders and directly assess and fund higher risk  borrowers. The key weakness is the P2P lending space has established players in other jusrisdictions outside Canada and these institutions can expand into Canada.

What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?
LL should expand into other loan products (e.g Consumer Finance) and should even consider funding for secured loans. Finance in many parts of the world is now performed through super apps (e.g Ant Financial) which provides everything from banking, wealth management, shopping, dining etc all from a single app. LL should consider expansion along the value chain to other product segments on its platform.
